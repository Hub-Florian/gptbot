# Web Scraping and Discord Bot Project

This project combines web scraping using Selenium in Python and integrates with a Discord bot to communicate with ChatGPT and retrieve information.

## Description

This project aims to automate the collection of information from websites using Selenium for web scraping. These collected data are then integrated into a Discord bot that communicates with ChatGPT to provide specific information in response to user queries.
Its basically like using the chat GPT API, but without cost

## Features

- **Selenium Web Scraping**: Using Selenium to extract data from websites.
- **Discord Bot**: Setting up a Discord bot capable of communicating with ChatGPT.
- **Interaction with ChatGPT**: The bot interacts with ChatGPT to get information and relay it to Discord users.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Selenium**: Used to automate the web browser and perform web scraping.
- **Discord API**: Utilized for developing the Discord bot.
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: API used for text generation and conversation interactions.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Project**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed. Use `pip` to install required dependencies.
3. **Selenium Configuration**: Set up Selenium with appropriate web browser drivers.
4. **Discord Bot Configuration**: Obtain necessary Discord API keys and configure them in the code.
5. **Run the Project**: Launch the main script to start the Discord bot.

## Usage Examples

Example of using the Discord bot:

- User (send message in a server where the bot is present): `$Capital of Venezuela`
- Discord Bot: The capital of Venezuela is Caracas.
